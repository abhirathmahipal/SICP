The first function is recursive in nature.

It needs to keep track of (inc (+ (dec a) b))) that is to be perfomed on an ever increasing number of sub problems.

(+ 4 5)
(inc (+ 3 5))
(inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
(inc (inc (inc (+1 4))))


The second is iterative in nature. It kind of resembles a for loop in C. While a != 0 keep reducing it and add 1 to b. The iterpreter does not need to keep track of operations to be performed. It can resume from where it left off.

(+ 4 5)
(+ 3 6)
(+ 2 7)
(+ 1 8)
(+ 0 9)
9
